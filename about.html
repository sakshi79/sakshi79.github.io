            Currently, I am a graduate student at Northeastern University, Boston, and a research assistant at the
            <a href="https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">
            Helping Hands Lab</a>, pursuing my Master's in Robotics.
            I did my undergraduate studies at the National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, India, where I received a B.Tech in
            Industrial and Production Engineering. My interests lie in using Vision-language models, and energy-based methods to enable robots to learn 
            from human demonstrations and instructions. Robot learning using traditional Reinforcement Learning based
            approaches is another domain I am actively interested in.
